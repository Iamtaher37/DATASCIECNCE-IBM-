      "source": " Arithmetic Expression Examples\n\nArithmetic expressions play a fundamental role in mathematical operations and programming. These expressions involve basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Understanding how to construct and evaluate arithmetic expressions is essential in various domains, including mathematics, computer science, and data science.\n\n Basic Arithmetic Operations\n\n1. **Addition (+):**\n   - The sum of two numbers. Example: `3 + 5` equals `8`.\n\n2. **Subtraction (-):**\n   - The difference between two numbers. Example: `7 - 4` equals `3`.\n\n3. **Multiplication (*):**\n   - The product of two numbers. Example: `2 * 6` equals `12`.\n\n4. **Division (/):**\n   - The quotient of dividing one number by another. Example: `10 / 2` equals `5`.\n\nOrder of Operations (PEMDAS)\n\nWhen dealing with multiple operations in an expression, it's important to follow the order of operations, commonly remembered using the acronym PEMDAS:\n\n1. **Parentheses (()):\n   - Operations enclosed in parentheses are performed first. Example: `(4 + 3) * 2` equals `14`.\n\n2. **Exponents (^):\n   - Exponentiation is the next operation. Example: `2^3` equals `8`.\n\n3. **Multiplication (*) and Division (/):\n   - These operations are performed from left to right. Example: `4 * 2 / 2` equals `4`.\n\n4. **Addition (+) and Subtraction (-):\n   - These operations are performed from left to right. Example: `10 - 3 + 2` equals `9`.\n\nUnderstanding and mastering these basic arithmetic expressions is crucial for more advanced mathematical and programming concepts. Let's explore and practice these examples to reinforce our understanding of arithmetic operations.\n",
